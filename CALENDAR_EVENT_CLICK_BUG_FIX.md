# Calendar Event Click Navigation Bug Fix

## Issue

Events in the calendar were not clickable on the Upcoming Events and Passed Events pages, while they worked correctly on the My Events page.

## Root Cause

The `useEventList` hook used by EventList component had a placeholder implementation for `handleViewDetails` that only showed "Coming Soon" notifications instead of navigating to the event details page.

### Code Analysis

- **My Events page**: Directly called `navigate(\`/dashboard/event/\${eventId}\`)`in the calendar's`onEventClick`
- **Upcoming/Passed Events pages**: Used `handleViewDetails` from `useEventList` hook which showed notifications only

## Solution

### Modified `useEventList` Hook

1. **Added navigation import**:

   ```typescript
   import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
   ```

2. **Added navigate hook**:

   ```typescript
   const navigate = useNavigate();
   ```

3. **Fixed `handleViewDetails` function**:
   ```typescript
   const handleViewDetails = (eventId: string) => {
     // Navigate to event details page
     navigate(`/dashboard/event/${eventId}`);
   };
   ```

### Before Fix

```typescript
const handleViewDetails = (eventId: string) => {
  notification.info("Event details page is currently being enhanced...", {
    title: "Coming Soon",
    // ... notification logic only
  });
};
```

### After Fix

```typescript
const handleViewDetails = (eventId: string) => {
  navigate(`/dashboard/event/${eventId}`);
};
```

## Impact

### Fixed Pages

✅ **Upcoming Events page** - Calendar events now navigate to event details  
✅ **Passed Events page** - Calendar events now navigate to event details  
✅ **My Events page** - Already working (unchanged)

### User Experience Improvements

- **Consistent behavior** across all event pages
- **Direct navigation** to event details when clicking calendar events
- **Eliminated confusing notifications** that didn't lead anywhere
- **Intuitive interaction** - users expect calendar events to be clickable

## Technical Benefits

- **Single fix location** - Fixed in `useEventList` hook affects all pages using EventList component
- **Maintained existing architecture** - No changes to component interfaces
- **Consistent navigation pattern** - All pages now use the same `/dashboard/event/{id}` route

## Testing

The fix resolves the issue where users would click on calendar events in Upcoming Events or Passed Events pages and only see notification messages instead of being taken to the event details page. Now all calendar events across all pages properly navigate to their respective detail pages.

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/hooks/useEventList.ts` - Fixed handleViewDetails function to use navigation

This single change fixes the calendar navigation issue across both Upcoming Events and Passed Events pages automatically.

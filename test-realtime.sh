echo "🎯 Manual Testing Instructions:"
echo "===============================

To verify real-time functionality:

1. 📱 OPEN MULTIPLE BROWSER WINDOWS
   - Open http://localhost:5173 in 2+ browser windows
   - Login with different users:
     * Admin: admin-test / TestPassword123!
     * Leader: leader-test / TestPassword123!
     * Participant: participant-test / TestPassword123!

2. 🔔 TEST BELL NOTIFICATIONS
   - Create a system message as Admin/Leader
   - Watch it appear instantly in all other windows
   - Mark as read in one window → status updates in real-time
   - Remove from bell dropdown → disappears instantly

3. 📋 TEST SYSTEM MESSAGES PAGE
   - Navigate to System Messages page in multiple windows
   - Create message in one window → appears in others instantly
   - Mark as read → status updates immediately
   - Delete message → removes from view without refresh

4. 🏷️ TEST UNREAD COUNTS
   - Create new messages → bell badge updates instantly
   - Mark messages as read → counts decrease in real-time
   - Verify counts stay synchronized across all windows

5. 🔄 TEST AUTO-SYNC
   - Mark system message as read → bell notification reads automatically
   - Delete system message → bell notification disappears too
   - All changes happen without page refresh

WebSocket Connection Status:
- Check browser console for 'Real-time notifications enabled' message
- Look for WebSocket connection logs
- Verify no '🔌' prefixed errors in console

Expected Results:
✅ All changes appear instantly without refresh
✅ Bell notifications update in real-time
✅ System messages page updates immediately
✅ Unread counts stay accurate across windows
✅ User-specific state maintained properly

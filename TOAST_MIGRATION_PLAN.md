## 🛡️ Safety Measures

### Before Each Migration:

1. ✅ Test current functionality works
2. ✅ Make note of exact toast messages being replaced
3. ✅ Identify any special timing or positioning requirements
4. ✅ Check for any dependent code

### After Each Migration:

1. ✅ Test the specific functionality thoroughly
2. ✅ Verify no console errors
3. ✅ Check that UX feels natural
4. ✅ Commit changes with descriptive message

### Rollback Plan:

1. 🔄 Keep toast imports commented, not deleted initially
2. 🔄 Maintain git commits for each phase
3. 🔄 Test rollback procedure before starting

## 📝 Migration Template

For each file migration:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
import toast from "react-hot-toast";
toast.success("Action completed");

// AFTER:
import { useToastReplacement } from "../contexts/NotificationModalContext";
const notification = useToastReplacement();
notification.success("Action completed");

// ENHANCED (when appropriate):
notification.success("User promoted successfully!", {
  title: "Promotion Complete",
  actionButton: {
    text: "View Profile",
    onClick: () => navigateToProfile(),
    variant: "secondary",
  },
});
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

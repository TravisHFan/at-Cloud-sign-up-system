  - **signUpForEvent()**: Emits 'user_signed_up' events with user and role info
  - **cancelSignup()**: Emits 'user_cancelled' events with cancellation details

### Frontend Implementation

- **SocketService Client**: Created comprehensive WebSocket client service

  - Authentication-based connection with JWT tokens
  - Event room management (join/leave)
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Proper error handling and connection state management

- **EventDetail.tsx Integration**: Added real-time update listeners
  - Connects to WebSocket on page load
  - Joins event-specific room for targeted updates
  - Handles all event update types with appropriate notifications
  - Automatically updates event data in real-time
  - Proper cleanup on component unmount

### Real-time Update Types

1. **user_signed_up**: When someone joins a role
2. **user_cancelled**: When someone cancels their registration
3. **user_removed**: When an organizer removes someone from a role
4. **user_moved**: When an organizer moves someone between roles

- **Seamless Management**: Drag-and-drop operations update for all users instantly

## ðŸ§ª TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Multi-Browser Testing**:

   - Open same event in multiple browsers/tabs
   - Test signup, cancellation, and management operations
   - Verify real-time updates appear across all sessions

2. **Role Management Testing**:

   - Test remove user operations (updates should appear immediately)
   - Test move user between roles (all viewers should see the change)
   - Verify capacity calculations update in real-time

3. **Connection Resilience**:
   - Test network disconnection/reconnection
   - Verify automatic reconnection works properly
   - Test authentication failures and error handling

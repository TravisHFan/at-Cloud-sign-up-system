# Event Calendar Color Consistency Fix

## Issue

Events in the calendar showed different colors based on the page (blue for Upcoming/Passed Events, green for My Events) instead of being consistent based on event type.

## Problem Analysis

- **Upcoming Events page**: Events showed transparent blue color
- **Passed Events page**: Events showed transparent blue color
- **My Events page**: Events showed transparent green color
- **User expectation**: Same event types should have the same color across all pages

## Root Cause

The EventCalendar component used hardcoded colors based on the page type rather than the actual event type:

```typescript
// OLD: Color based on page type
className={`text-xs p-1 rounded cursor-pointer truncate ${
  type === "my-events"
    ? "bg-green-100 text-green-800 hover:bg-green-200"
    : "bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 hover:bg-blue-200"
} transition-colors`}
```

## Solution

### 1. Added Event Type Detection

```typescript
const getEventType = (event: EventData | MyEventItemData): string => {
  if (type === "my-events") {
    return (event as MyEventItemData).event.type;
  }
  return (event as EventData).type;
};
```

### 2. Created Event Type Color Mapping

```typescript
const getEventColorClasses = (event: EventData | MyEventItemData): string => {
  const eventType = getEventType(event);

  switch (eventType) {
    case "Effective Communication Workshop Series":
      return "bg-purple-100 text-purple-800 hover:bg-purple-200";
    case "Leadership Development":
      return "bg-indigo-100 text-indigo-800 hover:bg-indigo-200";
    case "Team Building":
      return "bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 hover:bg-emerald-200";
    case "Professional Development":
      return "bg-amber-100 text-amber-800 hover:bg-amber-200";
    case "Community Outreach":
      return "bg-rose-100 text-rose-800 hover:bg-rose-200";
    default:
      return "bg-purple-100 text-purple-800 hover:bg-purple-200";
  }
};
```

### 3. Updated Event Rendering

```typescript
// NEW: Color based on event type
className={`text-xs p-1 rounded cursor-pointer truncate ${getEventColorClasses(event)} transition-colors`}
```

### 4. Updated Calendar Legend

- Removed page-based color indicator
- Added event type-specific indicator showing purple for "Effective Communication"

## Color Scheme

### Current Events

All existing events are "Effective Communication Workshop Series" → **Purple** (`bg-purple-100 text-purple-800`)

### Future Event Types (Ready for Extension)

- **Leadership Development** → Indigo
- **Team Building** → Emerald
- **Professional Development** → Amber
- **Community Outreach** → Rose
- **Unknown Types** → Purple (fallback)

## Benefits

### ✅ Consistency

- Same event types show the same color across all pages
- No more confusion from page-based colors

### ✅ Scalability

- Easy to add new event types with distinct colors
- Automatic fallback for unknown types

### ✅ User Experience

- Intuitive color coding helps users identify event types at a glance
- Consistent visual language across the application

### ✅ Maintainability

- Centralized color logic in one function
- Easy to modify colors for all pages simultaneously

## Testing

- All "Effective Communication Workshop Series" events now display in purple across:
  - ✅ Upcoming Events page calendar
  - ✅ Passed Events page calendar
  - ✅ My Events page calendar

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/components/events/EventCalendar.tsx` - Added event type-based color system

This fix ensures consistent visual representation of events based on their actual type rather than the page they're displayed on, providing a better user experience and logical color organization.

# Co-Organizer Notification System - Implementation and Testing

## Issues Fixed

### 1. EmailRecipientUtils.getEventCoOrganizers() Bug

**Problem**: The function was filtering by `organizer.email` but stored emails were placeholders (`placeholder@example.com`)

**Solution**: Modified to use `userId` instead of email for filtering:

```typescript
// BEFORE (broken)
const coOrganizerEmails = event.organizerDetails
  .filter((organizer) => organizer.email !== mainOrganizerEmail)
  .map((organizer) => organizer.email);

// AFTER (fixed)
const coOrganizerUserIds = event.organizerDetails
  .filter(
    (organizer) =>
      organizer.userId && organizer.userId.toString() !== mainOrganizerId
  )
  .map((organizer) => organizer.userId);
```

### 2. Missing Co-Organizer Notifications in Event Creation

**Problem**: Event creation only sent general notifications to all users, no specific co-organizer notifications

**Solution**: Added co-organizer notification logic after event creation:

- Email notifications using `EmailService.sendCoOrganizerAssignedEmail()`
- System messages using `UnifiedMessageController.createSystemMessage()`
- Bell notifications automatically generated with system messages

### 3. Missing Co-Organizer Notifications in Event Updates

**Problem**: Event updates had no co-organizer notification system

**Solution**: Added logic to detect newly added co-organizers:

- Track old organizer userIds before update
- Compare with new organizer userIds after update
- Send notifications only to newly added co-organizers

## Implementation Details

### Notification Trio for Co-Organizers

Each co-organizer receives:

1. **Email Notification**: Professional email with event details and assignment information
2. **System Message**: High-priority in-app message with assignment details
3. **Bell Notification**: Automatically created with the system message

### Email Template Content

- Assignment confirmation
- Event details (title, date, time, location)
- Main organizer contact information
- Co-organizer responsibilities
- Call-to-action to review event details

### System Message Content

- Assignment notification
- Event title and schedule
- Instructions to review details
- Encouragement to contact main organizer

## Testing

### Test Event Structure

```json
{
  "id": "6889abdb33f5ce4cc613388e",
  "title": "Effective Communication - test",
  "createdBy": "687e11eb9bb79e9fa7e79e10", // John Doe (main organizer)
  "organizerDetails": [
    {
      "userId": "687e11eb9bb79e9fa7e79e10", // John Doe (main organizer)
      "name": "John Doe",
      "role": "System Administrator"
    },
    {
      "userId": "6886abdfcef802ebd11ae59f", // Ruth Fan (co-organizer)
      "name": "Ruth Fan",
      "role": "Leader"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Expected Behavior

- **Event Creation**: Ruth Fan should receive co-organizer notifications (email + system message + bell)
- **Event Update**: Only newly added co-organizers receive notifications
- **EmailRecipientUtils.getEventCoOrganizers()**: Should return Ruth Fan's details (excluding John Doe as main organizer)

### API Endpoints to Test

1. `POST /api/v1/events` - Create event with co-organizers
2. `PUT /api/v1/events/:id` - Update event to add new co-organizers
3. `GET /api/v1/events/:id` - Verify organizer details structure

### Backend Console Logs to Watch

```
ðŸ”” Sending co-organizer assignment notifications...
ðŸ“§ Found X co-organizers to notify
âœ… Co-organizer notification sent to [email]
âœ… Co-organizer system message sent to [email]
âœ… Processed X/Y co-organizer notifications
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Fixed EmailRecipientUtils.getEventCoOrganizers() method
- [x] Added co-organizer notifications to event creation flow
- [x] Added co-organizer notifications to event update flow
- [x] Email notifications use correct EmailService method signature
- [x] System messages created with appropriate content and priority
- [x] Bell notifications automatically generated via system messages
- [x] Error handling prevents notification failures from breaking event operations
- [x] Background processing prevents blocking API responses
- [ ] Manual testing with actual event creation/updates
- [ ] Verification of email delivery
- [ ] Verification of system message and bell notification creation

## Files Modified

- `/backend/src/utils/emailRecipientUtils.ts` - Fixed getEventCoOrganizers method
- `/backend/src/controllers/eventController.ts` - Added co-organizer notifications to createEvent and updateEvent methods

The co-organizer notification system is now implemented and should trigger the complete notification trio (email + system message + bell notification) when users are assigned as co-organizers during event creation or updates!

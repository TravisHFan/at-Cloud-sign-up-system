## üî• Recent Achievements (September 2025)

### Event Status Labels on Program Pages ‚úÖ

- All program pages now show every linked event (past, ongoing, upcoming) with a clear status badge next to each title.
- Status is derived from backend status when present, with a robust date/time fallback to determine Upcoming/Ongoing/Past.
- Works in both client-side and server-side pagination modes; badges render consistently across pages.

### Layout Stabilization and Footer/Background Fixes ‚úÖ

- Resolved a bug where the footer could ‚Äúrise‚Äù leaving white space below on specific program pages.
- Standardized dashboard layouts to use `min-h-screen` with `flex flex-col` and added `pt-16` to account for the fixed header.
- Removed global `body` min-height to eliminate phantom white space interactions.
- Moved vertical spacing responsibility from the `Footer` to layout wrappers to avoid margin-collapse anomalies.
- Restored consistent gray background coverage app-wide.

### Accessibility & Pagination UX Improvements ‚úÖ

- Added an accessible ‚ÄúGo to page‚Äù control with range validation, clamping, and SR-only live announcements.
- Debounced Enter key handling to prevent accidental rapid page jumps.
- Clear disabled states for Prev/Next and a list-only loading spinner for server pagination.

### Pricing UX (Admin + Detail) ‚úÖ

- Program Detail displays a Pricing panel (when pricing exists) with computed examples (Standard, Class Rep, Early Bird, Combined), tolerant to both top-level and nested pricing shapes.
- Admin forms (Create/Edit Program) include pricing fields with validation: integers, 0‚Äì2000 ranges, and a combined discount guard (cannot exceed full price).
- Computed examples render live from form inputs with currency formatting.
- Help text was added to clarify pricing rules (integer ranges, combined-discount rule). Currency formatting is standardized across Create/Edit/Detail.

### Program Creation Bug Fix ‚úÖ

**Issue**: Create New Program form was not actually creating programs
**Root Cause**:

- Missing `programService` import in `CreateNewProgram.tsx`
- Commented-out API call in `onSubmit` function
- No data transformation for mentor objects

**Solution Implemented**:

```tsx
// Added proper import
import { fileService, programService } from "../services/api";

// Implemented actual program creation
const payload = {
  title: data.title,
  programType: data.programType,
  period: { startYear, startMonth, endYear, endMonth },
  introduction: data.introduction,
  flyerUrl: data.flyerUrl,
  fullPriceTicket: 0, // Default values
  classRepDiscount: 0,
  earlyBirdDiscount: 0,
  // Proper mentor transformation based on program type
  mentors: programType === "Effective Communication Workshops"
    ? effectiveCommunicationMentors.map(transformMentor)
    : undefined,
  mentorsByCircle: programType === "EMBA Mentor Circles"
    ? { E: eMentors.map(transformMentor), M: mMentors.map(transformMentor), ... }
    : undefined
};

await programService.create(payload);
```

**Validation**: End-to-end creation verified locally; full suite runs via `npm test`.

### Mentor Selection Enhancement ‚úÖ

- Fixed mentor picker to show all qualified users (Super Admin, Administrator, Leaders)
- Added `excludeMainOrganizer={false}` for mentor selection vs co-organizer selection
- Unified mentor selection UI across all program types

### Real-time Validation System ‚úÖ

- Implemented comprehensive field-level validation with `ValidationIndicator`
- Added overall form status with consistent styling
- Unified validation colors across Create Event and Create Program pages

### Layout Regression Tests ‚úÖ

- Added a lightweight regression test for `DashboardLayout` to guard header offset (`pt-16`) and footer placement within the scrollable area. This helps prevent reintroduction of the footer/whitespace bug.

## üß™ Testing Status

### Backend Tests ‚úÖ

- **Unit Tests**: 173 tests covering models, controllers, services, utilities
- **Integration Tests**: 130 tests covering API endpoints, authentication, real-time features
- **Total**: 303/303 tests passing
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of program CRUD, event relationships, mentor snapshots

**Key Test Areas**:

- Program creation/update/deletion with proper authorization
- Event-program bidirectional linking and sync
- Mentor snapshot creation and validation
- Pagination API with sorting and filtering
- Error handling and edge cases

### Frontend Tests ‚úÖ

- **Component & Integration**: Program detail badges covered; selectors updated where multiple ‚ÄúView‚Äù buttons exist
- **Skipped Test (intentional)**: One frontend test is skipped because it depends on live backend health; it‚Äôs gated to avoid flakiness in CI/local runs
- **E2E Coverage**: Program creation workflow, mentor selection, validation

**Key Test Areas**:

- Program CRUD operations and form validation
- Event creation with program selection
- Mentor selection for different program types
- Real-time validation system
- Pagination controls and accessibility

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Immediate Next Steps

1. Pricing UX (Phase 3B)

- Optional server-calculated pricing examples endpoint; add a client toggle to prefer server examples with client-side fallback.
- Consider a program-level feature flag to show/hide the pricing panel.

2. Layout Regression Coverage

- Add a companion regression test for `GuestDashboardLayout` mirroring the `DashboardLayout` checks (header offset, footer placement).
- Spot-check background coverage snapshots on a couple of key routes.

3. Pagination Policy & Defaults

- Decide default for `VITE_PROGRAM_EVENTS_PAGINATION` (server vs client) and document ops guidance.
- Add offline/health fallback: if server paging fails, transparently fall back to client mode.

4. Accessibility Polish

- Expand aria-live coverage for sorting changes; verify keyboard navigation on pagination controls.

5. Observability

- Add lightweight logging around program event fetching (server mode) to monitor latency and errors in production.

## üîÑ API Documentation

### Events API Extensions

**Endpoint Changes**:

```typescript
POST /api/events
PUT /api/events/:id

// Additional fields for program integration:
{
  programId?: string | null,        // MongoDB ObjectId of Program
  mentorCircle?: "E"|"M"|"B"|"A"|null  // For Mentor Circle events
}
```

**Behavior**:

- When `programId` provided: validates program exists, updates `Program.events` array
- When `mentorCircle` provided: snapshots mentors from `Program.mentorsByCircle[circle]`
- On update with changed `programId`: syncs old and new program event arrays
- On delete: removes event ID from linked program's events array

**Response Extensions**:

```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    event: {
      // Standard event fields...
      programId?: string,
      mentorCircle?: string,
      mentors?: UserRefLite[]  // Snapshotted mentor data
    }
  }
}
```

### Programs API

**Complete CRUD Interface**:

```typescript
// List programs with optional filtering
GET /api/programs?type=EMBA&q=searchTerm
Response: { success: true, data: Program[] }

// Get program details
GET /api/programs/:id
Response: { success: true, data: Program }

// List program events (paginated)
GET /api/programs/:id/events?page=1&limit=20&sort=date:asc
Response: { items: Event[], page: 1, total: 50, totalPages: 3, ... }

// Create program (Admin only)
POST /api/programs
Body: { title, programType, period, mentors/mentorsByCircle, ... }
Response: { success: true, data: Program }

// Update program (Admin only)
PUT /api/programs/:id
Body: { title?, mentors?, ... }
Response: { success: true, data: Program }

// Delete program (Admin only)
DELETE /api/programs/:id
Response: { success: true }
```

## üöÄ Deployment & Operations

### Feature Flags

- `VITE_PROGRAM_EVENTS_PAGINATION=server` - Enable server-side pagination (default: client)
- Ready for staged rollout and A/B testing

### Database Considerations

- Programs collection with proper indexing
- Event.programId indexed for efficient queries
- Mentor snapshots stored as embedded documents (no separate collection)

### Performance

- Server-side pagination reduces payload size for large programs
- Mentor snapshots avoid N+1 queries on event display
- Proper indexes on programId, programType, period fields

---

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

### Phase 4: Analytics & Reporting (Planned)

- [ ] Program engagement analytics
- [ ] Cross-program mentor utilization reports
- [ ] Pricing effectiveness analysis
- [ ] Event success metrics by program type

### Phase 5: Advanced UX (Future)

- [ ] Bulk event operations within programs
- [ ] Program templates and cloning
- [ ] Advanced mentor availability scheduling
- [ ] Integration with external calendar systems

### Phase 6: Scale & Performance (Future)

- [ ] Program archiving and lifecycle management
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering
- [ ] Bulk import/export capabilities
- [ ] Mobile-optimized program management

## üìö Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Mentor Snapshots**: Store mentor data at event creation time to preserve historical accuracy
2. **Bidirectional Linking**: Events know their program, programs maintain event arrays for performance
3. **Feature Flags**: Enable gradual rollout of pagination and other features
4. **Role-based Access**: Only Admins can create/modify programs, consistent with event permissions

### Technical Debt & Maintenance

- Pricing UI forms are the main remaining Phase 2 work item
- Consider mentor data sync strategies if real-time updates become required
- Monitor program-event relationship consistency in production

### Security Considerations

- All program mutations require Admin authentication
- Mentor data snapshots don't include sensitive information (phone numbers, etc.)
- Proper input validation on all program fields including pricing ranges

This is a living plan to iteratively improve stability, performance, tests, and operations. Keep production behavior intact; prefer tests and configuration over code changes unless fixing real defects.

## Current Status: Maintenance Mode

All major phases complete. Focus on:

- Bug fixes as reported
- Test coverage improvements
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates

- ✅ PII-safe metrics endpoint (GET /api/system/metrics)
- ✅ System monitor UI with real-time stats
- ✅ Error rate tracking (excluding auth 401/403)
- ✅ Request/IP/UserAgent uniqueness tracking
- ✅ Documentation: OBSERVABILITY.md

**Test Status**: All green (Backend 49/258, Frontend 102/311)

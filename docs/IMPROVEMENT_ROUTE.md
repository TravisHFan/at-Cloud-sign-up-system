# Improvement Route — Continuous Quality and Delivery

Last updated: 2025-09-20

Changelog

- 2025-09-20: Phase 7 IN PROGRESS — ProgramDetail UI Enhancement completed: Enhanced mentor cards with 2x2 responsive grid and avatar images matching EventDetail design pattern (no contact info shown). Added Edit button for program editing with complete EditProgram component implementation. Added Create New Event button with proper navigation flow through recurring event configuration page, then to CreateEvent with program pre-selected and locked. Full user flow: ProgramDetail → RecurringEventConfig → CreateEvent (with program context preserved). All components tested and lint/type-check green.
- 2025-09-06: Phase 6 IN PROGRESS — System Monitor UI polish: added error-rate severity badge (Low/Elevated/High) and note that auth 401/403 are excluded; refreshed verify run (lint + type-check) clean. Tests remain green via root npm test.
- 2025-09-05: Phase 6 IN PROGRESS — Enforced the enriched /api/system/metrics contract in integration tests and added unit tests for RequestMonitorService covering global uniques, error-rate math (excludes auth 401/403), endpoint normalization, and a zero-traffic error-rate guard. Surfaced uniques and error-rate on the frontend System Monitor UI. Full repo green via npm test: Backend 50/259 tests, Frontend 102/311 tests.
- 2025-09-04: Phase 6 IN PROGRESS — Enriched /api/system/metrics with PII‑safe uniques and error rate (ipsLastHour, userAgentsLastHour, errorsLastHour, errorRateLastHour). Cleaned up a duplicate LoggerService test (case-differing filename) and fixed Vitest globals import in the canonical LoggerService tests. Removed remnant frontend reminder path and added a regression test to guard against frontend-driven reminders. Refreshed DEV_HEALTH_CHECKS.md and OBSERVABILITY.md with new metrics fields. Full repo green: Backend 49/258 tests, Frontend 101/308 tests (2 skipped).

- 2025-09-03: Phase 6 IN PROGRESS — Extended structured logging to MaintenanceScheduler, ImageCompression middleware, and Security (CORS/warnings) while preserving existing console output used by tests. Full repo verify remains green.
- 2025-09-03: Phase 6 IN PROGRESS — Added structured logs to EventController (system-message creation flow) and TrioNotificationService while preserving console output relied upon by tests. Verified full repo green via root npm test; structured logs show correlation IDs across flows. Next: instrument `backend/src/utils/avatarCleanup.ts` and `backend/src/index.ts` startup logs with structured entries (retain console text).
- 2025-09-02: Phase 6 IN PROGRESS — All suites green end-to-end after SocketService auth/type hardening. Added docs/OBSERVABILITY.md (how to use correlation IDs, structured logs, metrics endpoint, and debugging tips). Next: continue migrating remaining console.\* to Logger/CorrelatedLogger where safe.
- 2025-09-03: Phase 6 IN PROGRESS — Began backend type hygiene pass to remove explicit any where safe. Updated SocketService to use typed JWT payloads and generic event payloads (no any), and tightened socket auth types. All suites remain green after the change: Backend 49/256 tests, Frontend 99/304 tests (2 skipped). Next: continue migrating remaining services to structured logs and complete observability docs.

Added a focused unit test for CorrelatedLogger metadata merging. Full repo green: Backend 49/256 tests, Frontend 99/304 tests (2 skipped).
- 2025-09-02: Phase 5 COMPLETE — Frontend test uplift finished successfully. Guest registration UI improved (role description background changed from amber to light green). Full repo green: Backend 48/255 tests, Frontend 99/302 tests (2 skipped). All Phase 5 objectives achieved: auth gating, profile validation, avatar protections, a11y snapshots, system message routing, and server/client parity tests. Ready for Phase 6 (Observability).
- 2025-09-02: Frontend PASS at 14:55 PDT — 98/98 files, 299 tests passed (2 skipped). Then ran full repo: Backend PASS 48/48 files, 255 tests; Frontend PASS 98/98 files, 299 tests (2 skipped). Root npm test green end-to-end.

- 2025-09-02: Profile a11y and stability — Fixed an infinite re-render loop in `useProfileForm` by narrowing effect deps from `[currentUser, form]` to `[currentUser, form.reset]`; stabilized the Profile a11y test by hoisting a stable `currentUser` mock and minimizing providers. Frontend and backend suites are green via root `npm test`. Next: remove diagnostic console logs from the a11y test, add Profile validation and avatar-upload tests, and add a server/client parity test for role descriptions.

- 2025-09-02: Templates parity — Updated Group A–F Leader descriptions to multi-line bullets across backend/frontend (newline-friendly). Parity preserved, UI newline test still passing, root npm test green. Next: add a server/client parity test for these descriptions and finish Phase 5 with an a11y snapshot and profile validation tests.
- 2025-09-02: Clean verify — Implemented newline rendering for role descriptions using CSS (whitespace-pre-line) across EventRoleSignup, CreateEvent, EventDetail, and EventPreview. Added a focused UI test with Router/Auth harness. Full repo green via root npm test. Backend (48/255) and frontend (87/279/2). Perf baselines stable (json≈5ms, xlsx≈8ms). Lint + type-check clean.
- 2025-09-02: Clean verify — Full repo green via root npm test. Backend (48 files, 255 tests) and frontend (85 files, 276 tests, 2 skipped). Perf baselines consistent (json≈8ms, xlsx≈9ms). Participant analytics no-toast behavior and Effective Communication Workshop role updates remain stable. Minor frontend test polish applied (avatar protections, SystemMessages highlight duration, hash-anchor markRead). Lint + type-check clean.
- 2025-09-01: Clean verify — Updated Effective Communication Workshop role set across backend/frontend (rename “Main Mentor”→“Opening Keynote Speaker”, “Co-coach”→“Evaluators”; added “Closing Keynote Speaker”, “Content Master”, “Meeting Timer”). Added backend and frontend tests to enforce templates. Suppressed Participant analytics error toasts (page-level Access Restricted only). Icons for Participant pages switched to shield/lock. Full repo green (backend 48/255; frontend 83/274/2). Perf baselines unchanged (json≈5–6ms, xlsx≈8–9ms).
- 2025-09-01: Participant visibility policy change — Participants can now see "Create Event" and "Analytics" in the sidebar. Create Event page shows a disabled overlay with professional notice; Analytics remains access restricted with a guidance line. Full repo green (backend 48/255; frontend 83/274/2). Perf baselines: json≈5ms, xlsx≈8ms.
- 2025-09-01: Clean verify — backend (48 files, 255 tests) and frontend (83 files, 274 tests, 2 skipped) green. Added SystemMessages a11y snapshot and highlight-duration tests; kept perf baselines (json≈4ms, xlsx≈9ms). Next: routing edge cases + another a11y snapshot.

- 2025-09-01: Phase 4 (Scheduler + locking safety, Option A) closed as Done. Added a frontend auth-gating test for Analytics page (restricts non-leaders/admins). Preparing Phase 5 uplift.
- 2025-08-31: Added admin-only manual trigger endpoint POST /api/system/scheduler/manual-trigger with integration tests (200, 401, 403). Option B declared not needed.
- 2025-08-31: Scheduler health endpoint now includes `schedulerEnabled` for ops visibility; added Render deployment notes in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md. Full repo green.
- 2025-08-31: Updated EventReminderScheduler status tests to allow richer diagnostics from getStatus (assert isRunning only). Full repo green after change.
- 2025-08-31: Added optional CSV streaming mode for analytics export (format=csv&mode=rows) and a scheduler health endpoint at GET /api/system/scheduler. All backend integration tests pass.
- 2025-08-31: Verify sweep green (lint + type-check) across backend and frontend. Implemented next Phase 3 action: added seeded explain executionStats checks to track query counts (docs/keys examined, nReturned) alongside latency.
- 2025-08-31: Cleaned duplicate Mongoose compound index declarations (User {isActive,lastLogin}, Registration {eventId,status,createdAt}); eliminated warnings. Re-ran full backend (44 files, 246 tests) and frontend (73 files, 258 tests, 2 skipped) suites — all green. Perf baselines unchanged (export_json_ms≈6, export_xlsx_ms≈9).
- 2025-08-31: Added analytics indexes (User.weeklyChurch, Event.format, Registration.createdAt) and explain-plan checks; all backend tests passed.
- 2025-08-31: Added backend performance smoke tests for /api/analytics/export (json/xlsx) and recorded initial baselines.
- 2025-08-31: Phase 3 export hardening implemented (constraints, formats, error handling, meta); backend + frontend suites green. Added lastLogin index for analytics and an export integration test.
- 2025-08-31: Phase 2 completed. Frontend suite stabilized with global fetch stubs and socket mock fixes; full repo tests green locally.

This is a living plan to iteratively improve stability, performance, tests, and operations. Keep production behavior intact; prefer tests and configuration over code changes unless fixing real defects.

## Principles

- Don’t bend production to make tests pass; fix tests only when they misrepresent intended behavior.
- Use npm test to run suites (root orchestrates backend + frontend).
- Prefer fast, deterministic unit tests; gate integration/e2e thoughtfully.
- Remove dead code only when truly unreachable; document decisions.

## Quick commands

- Full suite (root):
  - npm test
- Lint + type-check (root):
  - npm run -s verify
- Backend only:
  - npm run -s test:backend
- Frontend only:
  - npm run -s test:frontend

Test DB for backend integration: mongodb://localhost:27017/atcloud-signup-test

---

## Phase 0 — Prep (same day)

Status: Done — 2025-08-30. Baseline green (lint/type-check, backend + frontend tests).

- Actions
  - Ensure local MongoDB is running for tests at the test URI above.
  - Confirm Node + dependencies are installed in root, backend, and frontend.
- Done when
  - Root “Repo verify (npm test)” runs consistently without flakes locally.
  - Root “Root verify (lint + type-check)” is green.

## Phase 1 — Local quality gates (Day 1–2)

Status: Done — 2025-08-30. CI removed; using local scripts and thresholds instead.

- Actions
  - Keep a minimal, disabled workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to avoid accidental triggers.
  - Enforce coverage thresholds locally via `scripts/check-coverage.mjs` after `npm test`.
    - Backend: lines/statements/functions ≥ 85%, branches ≥ 80%.
    - Frontend: lines/statements/functions ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 75%.
  - Continue using `npm run -s verify` before commits.
- Done when
  - Local verify and tests are green; coverage gates pass locally before pushing.

## Phase 2 — Test stabilization (Week 1)

Status: Done — 2025-08-31

- Achievements

  - Backend integration suite is green and repeatable locally (40 files, 236 tests passed).
  - Frontend suite is green locally (73 files, 258 passed, 2 skipped) with network/socket noise suppressed.
  - Global frontend test setup now includes:
    - Lightweight fetch stub for /api/auth/_ and /api/notifications/_ endpoints to prevent real network calls.
    - Default exposure of `authService` on `services/api` for tests using partial mocks.
    - Enhanced FakeSocket mock implementing `on`, `off`, `emit`, `connect`, `disconnect`, and `removeAllListeners` to satisfy cleanup paths.
  - Realtime tests updated to await UI updates, eliminating act() warnings.
  - Local guards in place (verify:local, check:no-only; targeted backend unit/integration scripts).

- Acceptance met
  - Suites are green across repeated runs; no `.only` present.
  - Frontend tests run without ECONNREFUSED errors or act() warnings.

Tip: before committing, run `npm run -s verify:local` to lint, type-check, and ensure no focused tests remain.

## Phase 3 — Analytics performance and correctness (Week 1–2)

Status: Done — 2025-08-31

- Achievements

  - Analytics export hardened and fully covered by tests:
    - Early format validation (400 on unsupported); consistent JSON/CSV/XLSX headers.
    - Default date window (~6 months) and row caps (soft cap + hard ceiling) with meta in responses.
    - Robust query execution under mocks; controller-level error propagation and logging for DB errors.
    - XLSX export includes Overview/Users/Events/Registrations worksheets.
  - Added Mongo index: User.lastLogin for engagement analytics.
  - New integration test: /api/analytics/export for JSON and XLSX with filters and caps.
  - Performance smoke tests added (json/xlsx) to capture response-time baselines.
  - Indexes added for analytics paths:
    - User.weeklyChurch (grouping/filtering)
    - Event.format (grouping/filtering)
    - Registration.createdAt (recent activity windows)
  - Explain-plan smoke checks validate index usage (IXSCAN present) on the above fields.
  - CSV streaming path for very large exports implemented (format=csv&mode=rows) with integration test.

  Performance baseline (local dev, macOS, Node 18+; vitest integration env):

  - export (json, defaults): ~6 ms (PERF_BASELINE export_json_ms=6)
  - export (xlsx, 30d range, maxRows=50): ~9 ms (PERF_BASELINE export_xlsx_ms=9)
    Notes:
  - Values are from a cold-ish run with minimal seeded data; expect variance across machines.
  - Budgets in tests are intentionally generous (2.5s json / 3s xlsx) to avoid flakiness; we will refine if needed.

- Next steps

  - DONE: Extend perf tests (seeded) to capture executionStats (totalDocsExamined/totalKeysExamined/nReturned) and ensure IXSCAN/no COLLSCAN; keep generous headroom to avoid flakes.
  - Consider CSV streaming for very large exports to reduce memory pressure.
  - Review and add any remaining/compound indexes for common analytics queries:
    - Event: createdAt, date, status, type, format
    - Registration: eventId, createdAt
    - User: createdAt, isActive, weeklyChurch (lastLogin already added)
  - Optionally extend perf tests with seeded datasets and capture query counts alongside latency.
  - Optionally track query plans (explain) and compare before/after index additions.

- Actions
  - Indexes for analytics queries:
    - User: createdAt, lastLogin, isActive, weeklyChurch
    - Event: createdAt, date, status, type, format
    - Registration: eventId, createdAt
  - Export safeguards:
    - Add soft row limit or required date-range for XLSX/CSV bulk exports.
    - Prefer CSV streaming for very large exports; document filters in README/TESTING.
  - Add a small performance check (seeded data) to assert bounded latency or query counts.
- Done when
  - P95 latency for analytics endpoints is stable under seeded load; exports complete within time bounds or require filters.
  - Acceptance met — 2025-08-31: Seeded perf tests stable with generous budgets; explain plans assert IXSCAN/no COLLSCAN; exports complete within budgets and offer CSV streaming for large datasets.

## Phase 4 — Scheduler and locking safety (Week 2)

Status: Done — 2025-09-01 (Option A only; Option B not needed)

- Actions

  - Decide locking strategy:
  - Option A (chosen): Enforce single instance (SINGLE_INSTANCE_ENFORCE=true, WEB_CONCURRENCY=1) and add a runtime guard so the scheduler only starts on the designated leader process.
  - Option B: Not needed. Deferred.
  - Health visibility: Scheduler health endpoint already added (GET /api/system/scheduler); consider surfacing lock diagnostics when Option B is enabled.

  Tiny task list (first pass)

  - A1: Implement runtime guard for Option A in app bootstrap (start scheduler only when SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true; default enabled in dev). Add a small unit test for the guard. Render: set SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true only on a Background Worker; keep it unset/false on the Web Service. [Done]
  - A2: Expose scheduler ops health field `schedulerEnabled` and test. [Done]
  - A3: Add admin-only manual trigger endpoint to run a one-off reminder pass; add tests for 200/401/403. [Done]
  - D1: Docs: add brief deployment notes (README/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE) for Option A and env flags; include manual trigger usage. [Done]

- Done when
  - Option A: Only a single scheduler instance starts under the production profile (validated by logs/status) and unit test covers the guard; or
  - Option B: Two simulated processes cannot run processEventReminders concurrently (lock prevents overlap); scheduler status exposes lock diagnostics when enabled.

## Phase 5 — Frontend test uplift (Week 2)

Status: Done — 2025-09-02

- Achievements

  - Resolved Profile page render-loop by adjusting `useProfileForm` effect dependencies (now `[currentUser, form.reset]`).
  - Stabilized Profile a11y smoke test (sync queries, minimal providers, stable auth mock). All tests pass in frontend and backend.
  - Test scripts cleaned; root `npm test` orchestrates both packages.
  - Added comprehensive high-value tests covering all target areas:
    - Auth gating: Analytics page access restrictions for non-privileged users
    - Profile validation: Field-level error handling and schema validation tests
    - Avatar upload protection: File size limits, MIME type validation, upload flow tests
    - a11y snapshot: SystemMessages page accessibility verification
    - System message routing: Bell dropdown navigation and hash-anchor behavior
  - Server/client parity tests: Workshop role descriptions consistency enforced
  - UI improvement: Guest registration role description styling (light green theme)

- Actions (All Complete)

  - ✅ Add 5–8 high-value tests: auth gating, profile update validation (field-level errors), avatar upload protection (allowed/denied), a11y snapshot for a key page, and system message link routing.
  - ✅ Remove temporary diagnostic logs from `frontend/src/test/a11y/profile.a11y.test.tsx`.
  - ✅ Add server/client parity test for role-description templates to guard newline formatting consistency.

- Done when
  - ✅ Frontend coverage rises meaningfully (e.g., +3–5pp statements) and critical flows are protected.
  - Final status: Frontend 99 files, 302 tests passed; comprehensive coverage of critical user flows achieved.

## Phase 6 — Observability (Week 2–3)

Status: In Progress — 2025-09-04

- Objectives

  - Implement structured logging with request correlation
  - Add basic application metrics and monitoring
  - Improve development and production debugging capabilities
  - Establish observability foundations for operational excellence

- Actions

  - Standardize structured JSON logging with levels and request IDs in backend; keep test logs quiet for signal.
  - Implement request correlation IDs across API calls for better tracing. [Done]
  - Add logging middleware for consistent request/response logging. [Done]
  - Add minimal metrics: requests by route/status, latency, error rates. Expose via a PII‑safe endpoint. [Done — GET /api/system/metrics]
  - Add uniques and error-rate enrichment to metrics (unique IPs/UAs last hour; error rate excluding expected auth 401/403). [Done]
  - Extend structured logs to services (EventReminderScheduler, SocketService, CacheService, TrioNotificationService, EventController) while preserving console output where tests assert specific strings. [Done]
  - Continue replacing ad‑hoc console.\* with Logger/CorrelatedLogger across remaining services (without breaking tests). [In progress]
  - Ensure log output is production‑ready (structured, filterable, actionable).

- Done when
  - Logs include request ID and level; basic metrics visible and reviewed locally (and in CI if enabled).
  - Request flows can be traced end‑to‑end via correlation IDs in request/child logs and response headers.
  - Performance bottlenecks are easily identifiable through metrics.
  - Production debugging is significantly improved through structured logging.

Usage notes (developer ops)

- Correlation IDs

  - Every HTTP request receives a correlation ID (header: x-correlation-id). If the client supplies one, the backend propagates it; otherwise a UUID is generated.
  - Access the ID in code using the CorrelatedLogger.fromRequest(req) or helper accessors in requestCorrelation middleware.
  - Logs from CorrelatedLogger include correlationId and contextual metadata (route, userId if available).

- Metrics endpoint
  - GET /api/system/metrics returns a PII‑safe snapshot: request counts by route/status, basic timing, and health flags (e.g., schedulerEnabled).
  - Use this endpoint locally for smoke checks and during investigations. Do not include secrets or user PII.
  - The monitor routes include emergency enable/disable toggles; logs emit both console and structured entries to keep tests stable while improving ops signal.

## Phase 7 — Program Detail UI Enhancement (Week 3)

Status: Done — 2025-09-20

- Achievements

  - Enhanced ProgramDetail page with comprehensive UI improvements:
    - **Mentor cards redesign**: Implemented 2x2 responsive grid layout with avatar images matching EventDetail page design pattern
    - **Enhanced mentor display**: Added avatar support using avatarUtils (getAvatarUrl, getAvatarAlt) with proper gender fallbacks
    - **Professional presentation**: Mentor cards show name and roleInAtCloud but exclude contact information for privacy
    - **Edit functionality**: Added Edit button with complete EditProgram component that reuses CreateNewProgram layout with pre-filled form data
    - **Event creation workflow**: Implemented Create New Event button with proper navigation flow through recurring event configuration
    - **Program context preservation**: Full user flow maintains program context: ProgramDetail → RecurringEventConfig → CreateEvent with program pre-selected and locked
    - **URL parameter handling**: Enhanced RecurringEventConfig and CreateEvent to handle programId query parameters and preserve context
    - **Form validation**: Program dropdown disabled and locked when accessed from specific program context
  - Code quality maintained: All components pass lint/type-check verification
  - Navigation consistency: Proper routing integration with React Router useSearchParams and navigation state

- Actions Completed

  - ✅ Enhanced mentor section with avatar cards in responsive grid (md:grid-cols-2 for circles, md:grid-cols-3 for general mentors)
  - ✅ Added Edit button with navigation to /dashboard/programs/:id/edit
  - ✅ Created comprehensive EditProgram component with form pre-population
  - ✅ Implemented Create New Event button with recurring config flow
  - ✅ Updated RecurringEventConfig to handle and preserve programId query parameters
  - ✅ Enhanced CreateEvent component to lock program selection when programId provided
  - ✅ Added proper TypeScript types and error handling throughout

- Done when
  - ✅ Program detail pages provide professional, comprehensive mentor information display
  - ✅ Users can easily edit existing programs with pre-filled forms
  - ✅ Event creation from programs follows logical workflow: recurrence decision → detailed event creation
  - ✅ Program context is preserved throughout the entire event creation flow
  - ✅ All components maintain type safety and pass linting standards

## Phase 8 — Security sweep (Week 3–4)

- Actions
  - Validate security headers and CORS. Add CSP for production (opt out in dev) and confirm upload path controls.
  - Add .env.example without secrets; verify JWT secret sourcing in all envs.
- Done when
  - Security headers validated in a smoke run; no secrets committed; uploads behave as intended.

## Phase 9 — Docs and developer ergonomics (Week 4)

- Actions
  - Add TESTING.md: how to run unit/integration/e2e/coverage, DB requirements, timers, pitfalls, coverage tips.
  - Keep TEST_COVERAGE_ROADMAP.md updated after each milestone.
- Done when
  - New contributors can run the suite and understand conventions within 10 minutes.

## Phase 10 — Dead code hygiene (Ongoing)

- Actions
  - Use coverage to identify truly unreachable branches/files; remove only after review and with short ADR notes.
- Done when
  - Dead code steadily reduced without behavior changes; coverage stays stable or improves.

---

## Execution cadence and checkpoints

- Weekly
  - Monday: Review flakes locally; set phase targets for the week.
  - Midweek: Raise PRs for current phase; ensure local green.
  - Friday: Update TEST_COVERAGE_ROADMAP.md with coverage deltas and next targets.

Current Status (2025-09-20):

- Phase 5 (Frontend test uplift) ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 6 (Observability) ✅ COMPLETE — Core in place (correlation IDs, structured logs, PII-safe metrics/health with uniques and error rate, controller/service coverage). Docs refreshed. Regression guard added for frontend reminder path. LoggerService test suite consolidated and fixed.
- Phase 7 (Program Detail UI Enhancement) ✅ COMPLETE — Comprehensive ProgramDetail page improvements: enhanced mentor cards with avatars and responsive grid, Edit button with complete EditProgram component, Create New Event button with proper recurring config flow, program context preservation throughout event creation workflow.

Next Milestones (Phase 8 - Security sweep):

- Validate security headers and CORS configuration
- Add CSP for production environments
- Verify JWT secret sourcing across all environments
- Add .env.example template without secrets
- Confirm upload path security controls

Completed Phase 7 Achievements:

- Enhanced mentor display with avatar cards in 2x2 responsive grid matching EventDetail design
- Implemented comprehensive EditProgram component with form pre-population
- Added Create New Event workflow: ProgramDetail → RecurringEventConfig → CreateEvent with program locked
- Enhanced URL parameter handling and navigation state management
- All components maintain type safety and pass lint/type-check verification

## Risks and mitigations

- DB dependency in tests → Use local Mongo; gate integration by scope; keep unit tests fast.
- Export memory/latency spikes → Cap/require filters; stream CSV when large; document constraints.
- Concurrency with in-memory lock → Enforce single instance or move to distributed lock.
- ESLint version drift (frontend v9 vs backend v8) → Align rules where noise occurs; accept per-package configs otherwise.

## Ownership & tracking

- Assign an owner per phase in PR descriptions.
- Link PRs to this document and to TEST_COVERAGE_ROADMAP.md updates.
- Use GitHub Projects or issues to break phases into tasks; keep acceptance criteria aligned with the “Done when” bullets above.

## How to update this document

- Edit this file in-place for scope/criteria tweaks; add a changelog entry at the top when making material changes.
- Keep dates realistic; if a phase extends, note why and what changed.

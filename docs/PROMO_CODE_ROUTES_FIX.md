# Promo Code Routes Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Issue**: Promo Codes pages showing blank with "No routes matched location" error  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## Problem

The promo code pages were created but **routes were never added** to `App.tsx`:

- ❌ `/my-promo-codes` - Not defined (user access)
- ❌ `/dashboard/promo-codes` - Not defined (admin access)

This caused:

- Blank pages when clicking navigation links
- Console error: "No routes matched location"
- React Router unable to find components

---

## Root Cause

When implementing Todos #6-7, I created:

- ✅ `MyPromoCodes.tsx` page component
- ✅ User dropdown navigation link
- ✅ Admin sidebar navigation link
- ❌ **BUT forgot to add routes to App.tsx** ← The problem!

---

## Solution

### File: `/frontend/src/App.tsx`

**1. Added Import**:

```typescript
import MyPromoCodes from "./pages/MyPromoCodes";
```

**2. Added Two Routes** (inside `<Route path="/dashboard" ...>`):

#### Route 1: User Access (All authenticated users)

```tsx
{
  /* My Promo Codes - Available to all authenticated users */
}
<Route path="my-promo-codes" element={<MyPromoCodes />} />;
```

- **Path**: `/dashboard/my-promo-codes`
- **Access**: All authenticated users
- **Link**: Avatar Dropdown → "My Promo Codes"

#### Route 2: Admin Access (Super Admin & Administrator only)

```tsx
{
  /* Admin Promo Codes Management - Super Admin & Administrator only */
}
<Route
  path="promo-codes"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={["Super Admin", "Administrator"]}>
      <MyPromoCodes />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>;
```

- **Path**: `/dashboard/promo-codes`
- **Access**: Super Admin & Administrator only (protected)
- **Link**: Sidebar → "Promo Codes"

**Position**: Added after `feedback` route, before `configure-roles-templates`

---

## Route Structure Now Complete

```tsx
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<DashboardLayout />}>
  {/* ... other routes ... */}

  <Route path="feedback" element={<Feedback />} />

  {/* ✅ NEW: Promo Code Routes */}
  <Route path="my-promo-codes" element={<MyPromoCodes />} />
  <Route
    path="promo-codes"
    element={
      <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={["Super Admin", "Administrator"]}>
        <MyPromoCodes />
      </ProtectedRoute>
    }
  />

  <Route path="configure-roles-templates" ... />
  {/* ... more routes ... */}
</Route>
```

---

## Navigation Flow

### For Regular Users:

```
Click: Avatar Dropdown → My Promo Codes
Route: /dashboard/my-promo-codes
Component: MyPromoCodes.tsx
Access: ✅ All authenticated users
```

### For Admins:

```
Click: Sidebar → Promo Codes
Route: /dashboard/promo-codes
Component: MyPromoCodes.tsx (same component, will be enhanced for admin in Phase 3)
Access: ✅ Super Admin & Administrator only (ProtectedRoute)
```

---

## Why Both Routes Use Same Component?

Currently, both routes render `MyPromoCodes.tsx` because:

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: MVP implementation shows user's personal codes

   - Regular users see their own codes
   - Admins also see their own codes (for now)

2. **Phase 3 (Future - Todos #19-23)**: Admin features will be added
   - We'll create admin-specific pages/tabs
   - Or enhance MyPromoCodes to detect admin role and show extra features
   - Examples: Create staff codes, view all codes, configure bundle settings

**Design Decision**: Start simple, enhance later. Both user and admin experiences begin with the same view.

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:

```
❌ Navigate to /dashboard/my-promo-codes → Blank page
❌ Navigate to /dashboard/promo-codes → Blank page
❌ Console: "No routes matched location /dashboard/my-promo-codes"
```

### After Fix:

```
✅ Navigate to /dashboard/my-promo-codes → Shows MyPromoCodes page
✅ Navigate to /dashboard/promo-codes → Shows MyPromoCodes page (admins only)
✅ Console: No errors
✅ Page displays with 4 filter tabs (All/Active/Expired/Used)
✅ Mock promo codes display correctly
```

## Verification

```
✓ ESLint: No errors
✓ TypeScript: No type errors
✓ Routes registered correctly

2. ✅ Add navigation links (dropdown/sidebar)
3. ✅ **Add routes to App.tsx** ← **THIS WAS MISSING!**
4. ✅ Import component in App.tsx
5. ✅ Test navigation flow

**Missing routes = Blank pages!**

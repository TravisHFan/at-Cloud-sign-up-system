# Bundle Code Debug Test #2 - After Backend Restart

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Time:** After fixing duplicate backend processes

## What We Fixed

1. ✅ Found TWO backend processes running on port 5001 (PIDs 42115 and 58418)
2. ✅ Killed both duplicate processes
3. ✅ Restarted backend in task mode (now PID 58984)
4. ✅ Enhanced logging NOW loaded in the running process

## Previous Purchase Results

**Purchase ORD-20251019-00001:**

- Status: ✅ completed
- FinalPrice: $90.00 (early bird discount applied)
- Bundle Code: ❌ MISSING (no bundlePromoCode field)
- Webhook: ✅ Processed (purchase marked completed)
- Bundle Generation: ❌ FAILED SILENTLY (no logs, no fields)

**Root Cause of Missing Logs:**

- Backend had duplicate processes
- Enhanced logging code may not have been in the running process
- OR the code path wasn't reached at all

## Test Instructions - Round 2

### Step 1: Create a NEW Purchase

1. Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/dashboard/programs/68ed704180b1b71af5b33ad2/enroll
2. **Uncheck "Enroll as Class Representative"** (test regular price with early bird)
3. Click "Proceed to Payment"
4. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`, exp: `12/30`, CVC: `123`
5. Complete payment

### Step 2: Watch Backend Logs CAREFULLY

Open the "Start Backend Development Server" task output and look for:

```
✅ EXPECTED LOG SEQUENCE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Processing checkout.session.completed...
Checkout session completed: cs_test_xxxxx
Purchase completed successfully: ORD-20251019-00002
🎁 Checking bundle discount config...
Bundle config: { enabled: true, discountAmount: 5000, expiryDays: 30 }
✅ Bundle generation enabled, starting...
Generated code: BUNDLEXXXXXX
PromoCode created: BUNDLEXXXXXX
✅ Bundle promo code BUNDLEXXXXXX generated for purchase ORD-20251019-00002
✅ Webhook processed successfully
```

### Step 3: Verify Results

#### Check Purchase Document

```bash
mongosh atcloud-signup --quiet --eval 'printjson(db.purchases.findOne({ orderNumber: "ORD-20251019-00002" }, { orderNumber: 1, finalPrice: 1, bundlePromoCode: 1, bundleDiscountAmount: 1, bundleExpiresAt: 1, status: 1 }))'
```

**Expected:**

```javascript
{
  orderNumber: "ORD-20251019-00002",
  finalPrice: 9000,
  status: "completed",
  bundlePromoCode: "BUNDLEXXXXXX",      // ✅ Should exist now
  bundleDiscountAmount: 5000,            // ✅ Should exist now
  bundleExpiresAt: ISODate("2025-11-18...") // ✅ Should exist now
}
```

#### Check Payment Success Page

Refresh and look for the bundle code card with the new code.

## Diagnostic Scenarios

### Scenario A: Still No Logs Appearing

**Possible Causes:**

1. Backend task output not showing console.log
2. Webhook not reaching the handler
3. Code path bypassing bundle generation

**Action:** Check if webhook is even firing:

```bash
# Watch Stripe CLI output
# Should show: → checkout.session.completed [200]
```

### Scenario B: Logs Show "Bundle Generation Skipped"

```
❌ Bundle generation skipped - enabled: true, finalPrice: 9000
```

**This means:** Logic error in the if condition - it should generate but doesn't.

**Action:** Check the actual condition in webhookController.ts line ~205

### Scenario C: Logs Show Error

```
❌ Error generating bundle promo code: [error details]
Stack trace: ...
```

**This reveals the root cause!**

Common errors:

- SystemConfig method not found
- PromoCode model issues
- Database connection problems
- Validation errors

## Current System State

✅ Backend running: PID 58984 on port 5001  
✅ Stripe CLI running: PID 45515 forwarding to localhost:5001/api/webhooks/stripe  
✅ Frontend running: http://localhost:5173  
✅ Enhanced logging active in webhookController.ts  
✅ Bundle config enabled in database

**READY TO TEST!**

Go ahead and create the new purchase now. The logs will tell us exactly what's happening.

# Phase 2 Complete: Test Suite Updated

**Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Next:** Phase 3 - Implementation

---

## Summary

Phase 2 has been successfully completed. We've updated all existing test files to remove mentor circle logic and replace it with programLabels tests.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated Unit Test File ✅

**File:** `backend/tests/unit/controllers/eventController.mentorCircle.test.ts`

**Changes:**

- Removed 6 mentor circle tests (programId requirement, mentorCircle requirement, mentor merging, deduplication, role filtering)
- Added 7 new programLabels tests:
  1. Accept empty programLabels array
  2. Accept single program in array
  3. Accept multiple programs in array
  4. Reject invalid program ID
  5. Reject non-existent program ID
  6. Filter out null/undefined/empty values
  7. Deduplicate program IDs

**Test Results:**

```
Test Files: 1 failed (expected)
Tests: 7 failed (expected)
Duration: 403ms

Reason: Code not implemented yet - all tests returning 400 errors
```

### 2. Updated Integration Test File ✅

**File:** `backend/tests/integration/events.programs.integration.test.ts`

**Changes:**

- Removed 1 mentor snapshot test (programId + mentorCircle → mentors)
- Added 3 new programLabels integration tests:
  1. Event linked to multiple programs via programLabels array
  2. Event with single program (backward compatible)
  3. Event with no programs (empty programLabels)

**Test Results:**

```
Test Files: 1 failed (expected)
Tests: 3 failed (expected)
Duration: 1.76s

Reason: Code not implemented yet - all tests returning 400 errors
```

## Total Test Coverage

### Created in Phase 1 ✅

- `events-program-labels.integration.test.ts` - 22 tests

### Updated in Phase 2 ✅

- `eventController.mentorCircle.test.ts` - 7 tests (replaced)
- `events.programs.integration.test.ts` - 3 tests (replaced)

### Total Tests for programLabels Feature

**32 comprehensive test cases** covering:

- Create events with 0, 1, or multiple programs
- Update events to add/remove/replace programs
- Validation (invalid IDs, non-existent programs)
- Edge cases (large arrays, null values, duplicates)
- Filter/query by programLabels
- Program.events bidirectional sync
- Backward compatibility

---

## Test Status

All 32 tests are currently **FAILING** ✅ (expected)

This is the correct state - tests should fail until we implement the functionality. This validates:

1. Tests are running correctly
2. Tests are detecting the missing functionality
3. We have clear success criteria (tests will turn green)

---

## Files Modified

### Test Files

1. ✅ `backend/tests/unit/controllers/eventController.mentorCircle.test.ts` (417 lines)

   - Replaced all mentor circle logic with programLabels tests

2. ✅ `backend/tests/integration/events.programs.integration.test.ts` (150 lines)

   - Replaced mentor snapshot test with multi-program tests
   - Tests: 3 tests, 0 passing (expected)

3. ✅ `backend/tests/integration/events-program-labels.integration.test.ts` (648 lines)
   - Created in Phase 1
   - Tests: 22 tests, 0 passing (expected)

### Documentation

4. ✅ `docs/TEST_PLAN_PROGRAM_LABELS.md` - Test strategy
5. ✅ `docs/TEST_FIRST_APPROACH_STATUS.md` - Progress tracking

## Verification Commands

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
cd backend
npx vitest run tests/unit/controllers/eventController.mentorCircle.test.ts --reporter=verbose
```

**Expected:** 7 failed tests (missing implementation)

### Run Integration Tests

```bash
npm run test:integration:one tests/integration/events.programs.integration.test.ts
```

**Expected:** 3 failed tests (missing implementation)

### Run New Integration Tests

```bash
npm run test:integration:one tests/integration/events-program-labels.integration.test.ts
```

**Expected:** 22 failed tests (missing implementation)

### Total

```bash
# All programLabels tests
npm run test -- events-program-labels
npm run test -- eventController.mentorCircle
npm run test -- events.programs
```

**Expected:** 32 failed tests (missing implementation)

---

## Success Criteria for Phase 2

- [x] Remove mentor circle tests from unit tests
- [x] Replace with programLabels tests
- [x] Update integration tests for programs
- [x] All test files compile without errors
- [x] Tests executable and failing as expected
- [x] Clear validation that tests detect missing functionality

---

## Ready for Phase 3

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Complete eventController.updateEvent** (~100 lines)

   - Replace prevProgramId/nextProgramId with array logic
   - Calculate added/removed programs (array diff)
   - Remove mentor snapshot refresh logic

2. **Update program sync after save** (~50 lines)

   - Loop through added programs
   - Loop through removed programs
   - Update Program.events arrays

3. **Update filter/query APIs** (~50 lines)

   - Update getEvents() to use $in operator for programLabels
   - Update searchEvents() filter logic
   - Handle programId query param → programLabels array

4. **Clean up remaining references**
   ```bash
   grep -n "programId" eventController.ts | grep -v programLabels
   grep -n "mentorCircle" eventController.ts
   grep -n "\.mentors" eventController.ts
   ```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Make one change at a time**
2. **Run tests after each change**
3. **Watch tests turn green incrementally**
4. **Stop if any unexpected failures**
5. **Commit working state frequently**

---

## Expected Outcomes After Phase 3

Once implementation is complete:

```
✅ Unit tests: 7/7 passing
✅ Integration tests (events.programs): 3/3 passing
✅ Integration tests (events-program-labels): 22/22 passing
✅ Total: 32/32 passing
✅ Coverage: 99%+
✅ No regressions in existing tests
```

---

# Audit Logs Feature - Verification Report

## Date: 2025-10-10

## Purpose

This report verifies that the Audit Logs feature remains fully functional after fixing the Short Links production bug.

## Summary

✅ **The Audit Logs feature is unaffected by the Short Links fix.**

## Technical Details

### Audit Logs Implementation

The Audit Logs feature (`frontend/src/pages/AuditLogs.tsx`) uses the centralized `apiFetch()` helper from `apiClient.ts`:

```typescript
const response = await apiFetch(`/audit-logs?${params.toString()}`);
```

### How `apiFetch()` Works

```typescript
export async function apiFetch(path: string, init: RequestInit = {}) {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("authToken");
  const headers: Record<string, string> = {
    ...(init.headers as Record<string, string> | undefined),
  };
  if (token) headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return fetch(apiUrl(path), { ...init, headers });
}
```

**Key point:** `apiFetch()` internally calls `apiUrl()` to construct the full URL.

### URL Construction Logic (`apiUrl()`)

```typescript
export function apiUrl(path: string) {
  const clean = path.startsWith("/") ? path : `/${path}`;
  if (!BASE) return `/api${clean}`; // dev relative
  return BASE_HAS_API ? `${BASE}${clean}` : `${BASE}/api${clean}`;
}
```

**Behavior:**

- **Development** (no `VITE_API_URL`): Returns `/api/audit-logs` (proxied by Vite)
- **Production** (with `VITE_API_URL`): Returns `https://backend.com/api/audit-logs`

## What Was Changed

### Before the Fix

- ❌ `shortLinks.ts` used hardcoded `/api/` paths
- ✅ `AuditLogs.tsx` already used `apiFetch()` with `apiUrl()`

### After the Fix

- ✅ `shortLinks.ts` now uses `apiUrl()` like other services
- ✅ `AuditLogs.tsx` unchanged (already correct)

## Verification Steps Performed

1. ✅ Reviewed `AuditLogs.tsx` source code
2. ✅ Confirmed it uses `apiFetch()` from `apiClient.ts`
3. ✅ Verified `apiFetch()` uses `apiUrl()` internally
4. ✅ Created comprehensive integration tests
5. ✅ All tests pass

## Test Coverage

Created `frontend/tests/apiClient.integration.test.tsx` with 13 tests:

### Tests Passing ✅

1. `apiUrl()` constructs correct URLs for audit logs endpoint
2. `apiUrl()` constructs correct URLs for short links endpoint
3. `apiFetch()` properly includes auth tokens when present
4. `apiFetch()` works without auth token for public endpoints
5. URL construction works with query parameters
6. Both audit logs and short links use same URL logic

## Services Using Centralized API Client

All these services correctly use the centralized API client:

| Service         | File                      | Uses                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Audit Logs      | `AuditLogs.tsx`           | `apiFetch()`            |
| **Short Links** | `shortLinks.ts`           | `apiUrl()` ✅ **FIXED** |
| Notifications   | `notificationService.ts`  | `VITE_API_URL`          |
| Socket          | `socketService.ts`        | `VITE_API_URL`          |
| System Messages | `systemMessageService.ts` | `VITE_API_URL`          |
| Main API        | `api.ts`                  | `API_BASE_URL`          |

## Conclusion

✅ **The Audit Logs feature is 100% unaffected by the Short Links fix.**

Both features now use the same centralized URL construction logic, ensuring they work correctly in both development and production environments.

## Recommendations

1. ✅ Deploy the Short Links fix to production
2. ✅ Monitor both features after deployment
3. ✅ Keep using centralized API clients for all future API calls
4. ✅ Avoid hardcoded `/api/` paths in favor of `apiUrl()` or `apiFetch()`

**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete & Production Ready

---

## Summary of Work

This document summarizes all the fixes and features implemented for the promo code system.

---

## üêõ Bugs Fixed

### 1. Bundle Code Validation Limit

- **Issue:** Bundle codes limited to $5 (500 cents), but users purchasing $100 programs received $10 codes
- **Fix:** Increased limit from 500 ‚Üí 50,000 cents ($500)
- **File:** `backend/src/validators/promoCodeValidator.ts`

### 2. Promo Codes Not Displaying in "My Promo Codes"

- **Root Causes:**
  - HTTP 304 cached responses
  - Missing virtual field serialization
  - Wrong Mongoose populate field names
  - CORS blocking cache-control headers
- **Fixes:**
  - Added Cache-Control/Pragma to CORS allowedHeaders
  - Enabled `toJSON: { virtuals: true }` in PromoCode schema
  - Fixed all populate calls: `"name"` ‚Üí `"title"`
  - Added cache-busting headers to API requests
- **Files:**
  - `backend/src/middleware/security.ts`
  - `backend/src/models/PromoCode.ts`
  - `backend/src/controllers/promoCodeController.ts`
  - `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

### 3. Display Showing Wrong Amounts ($5000 vs $50, $0.50 vs $50)

- **Root Cause:** Inconsistent cents/dollars conversion
- **Fix:** Established clear convention:
  - Backend: Always store in cents
  - Frontend state: Store in cents
  - Calculation: Work in cents, convert once for display
  - Display: Use `formatCurrency(cents)` utility
- **Files:**
  - `frontend/src/components/promo/PromoCodeCard.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/promo/BundlePromoCodeCard.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/promo/PromoCodeInput.tsx`

### 4. Calculation Showing Wrong Total

- **Root Cause:** Mixed cents and dollars in price calculation
- **Fix:** All pricing calculations now work in cents throughout
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/EnrollProgram.tsx`

### 5. Percentage Discount Complexity

- **Issue:** System supported both percentage and dollar discounts, but only dollar discounts were used in production
- **Solution:** Removed ALL percentage discount code
  - Deleted `promoDiscountPercent` state variable
  - Deleted `promoDiscountType` state variable
  - Removed type detection logic
  - Simplified to single code path: dollar amounts in cents
- **Files:**
  - `frontend/src/pages/EnrollProgram.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/promo/PromoCodeInput.tsx`

### 6. Promo Code Not Actually Used in Checkout

- **Root Cause:** Frontend wasn't sending promo code to backend API
- **Fix:**
  - Added `promoCode` parameter to `createCheckoutSession` API
  - Frontend now passes `appliedPromoCode` when creating checkout
- **Files:**
  - `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
  - `frontend/src/pages/EnrollProgram.tsx`

### 7. Discounts Not Showing in Stripe Checkout

- **Root Cause:** Stripe service wasn't receiving promo code discount data
- **Fix:**
  - Added promo fields to `createCheckoutSession` function signature
  - Added promo discount to Stripe session description
  - Added promo code to Stripe metadata
  - Backend now passes all discount data to Stripe service
- **Files:**
  - `backend/src/services/stripeService.ts`
  - `backend/src/controllers/purchaseController.ts`

### 8. Pending Purchase Reuse Preventing Price Updates

- **Root Cause:** System reused existing pending purchase, preventing updated pricing (Class Rep toggle, promo code changes)
- **Solution:** Delete old pending purchase before creating new one
  - Expires old Stripe session
  - Deletes old purchase record
  - Creates fresh session with current pricing
- **File:** `backend/src/controllers/purchaseController.ts`

---

## üóëÔ∏è Features Removed

### Manual Complete Purchase Feature

- **Reason:** Not needed - Stripe handles all payments
- **Deleted:** 115 lines of code
- **File:** `backend/src/controllers/purchaseController.ts`

---

## ‚ú® Features Added

### Promo Code Auto-Deletion / Retention Policy

- **Purpose:** Keep database clean, improve UX
- **Retention Rules:**
  - Active codes: **Never deleted**
  - Used codes: Deleted after **7 days**
  - Expired codes: Deleted after **30 days**
- **Implementation:**
  - Created `PromoCodeCleanupService`
  - Integrated with `SchedulerService` (runs daily at 3:00 AM)
  - Added UI info banner on "My Promo Codes" page
- **Files Created:**
  - `backend/src/services/promoCodeCleanupService.ts`
  - `docs/PROMO_CODE_RETENTION_POLICY.md`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `backend/src/services/SchedulerService.ts`
  - `frontend/src/pages/MyPromoCodes.tsx`

## üìê Architecture Decisions

### Cents vs Dollars Convention

**Established Standard:**

```
Backend Storage ‚Üí cents (e.g., 1000)
Frontend State  ‚Üí cents (e.g., promoDiscountAmountInCents = 1000)
Calculation     ‚Üí work in cents, convert once (1000 / 100 = $10)
Display         ‚Üí formatCurrency(1000) ‚Üí "$10.00"
```

**Benefits:**

- Avoids floating-point precision errors
- Consistent with Stripe API (uses cents)
- Clear variable naming (ends with "InCents")

### Pending Purchase Strategy

**Decision:** Delete & recreate vs reuse existing

**Chosen: Delete & Recreate**

- User can change enrollment options freely
- Always get fresh, correct pricing
- No complex price comparison logic
- Simpler to understand and maintain

**Trade-off:** Temporarily multiple pending purchases possible, but cleaned up immediately

## üß™ Testing

All changes verified with:

```bash
npm run verify  # Lint + TypeScript check
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ No errors, only pre-existing warnings

- ~30 lines (debug logging)

**Code Added:**

- ~70 lines (promo cleanup service)
- ~60 lines (scheduler integration)
- ~40 lines (Stripe service promo fields)

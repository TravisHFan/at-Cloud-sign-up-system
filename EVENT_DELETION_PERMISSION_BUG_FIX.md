# Event Deletion Permission Bug Fix - August 2, 2025

## 🐛 **Bug Report**

### **Issue Description**

Event deletion behavior was inconsistent across user roles:

- **Travis Fan (Super Admin)**: Could delete events with registered participants directly ✅
- **Ruth Fan (Leader)**: Blocked from deleting events with participants, received error message ❌

### **User Report**

> "Event Has Participants
> Cannot delete event with registered participants. Please remove all participants first."

### **User Expectation**

> "Everyone who have the authority to delete an event, should delete it directly, with the registration inside also deleted, just like what Travis Fan can do."

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Technical Investigation**

**Location**: `/backend/src/controllers/eventController.ts` lines 1075-1085

**Problematic Code**:

```typescript
// For Super Admins, allow force deletion with cascade
const canForceDelete = req.user.role === "Super Admin"; // ❌ HARDCODED ROLE CHECK
```

**Issue**: The code used a hardcoded role check instead of the permission system, causing:

1. **Administrators** with `DELETE_ANY_EVENT` permission to be blocked
2. **Leaders** with `DELETE_OWN_EVENT` permission (for their own events) to be blocked

### **Permission System Analysis**

| Role              | DELETE_ANY_EVENT | DELETE_OWN_EVENT | Expected Behavior           | Actual Behavior |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Super Admin**   | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes           | Can force delete any event  | ✅ Working      |
| **Administrator** | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes           | Can force delete any event  | ❌ **BLOCKED**  |
| **Leader**        | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes           | Can force delete own events | ❌ **BLOCKED**  |
| **Participant**   | ❌ No            | ❌ No            | Cannot delete events        | ✅ Working      |

## ✅ **Fix Implementation**

### **Code Changes**

**File**: `/backend/src/controllers/eventController.ts`

**Before (Broken)**:

```typescript
// For Super Admins, allow force deletion with cascade
const canForceDelete = req.user.role === "Super Admin";

if (!canForceDelete) {
  res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message:
      "Cannot delete event with registered participants. Please remove all participants first, or contact a Super Admin for force deletion.",
  });
  return;
}
```

**After (Fixed)**:

```typescript
// Check if user has permission to force delete events with participants
// This should be based on permissions, not hardcoded roles
const canForceDelete =
  canDeleteAnyEvent || (canDeleteOwnEvent && isEventOrganizer);

if (!canForceDelete) {
  res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message:
      "Cannot delete event with registered participants. Please remove all participants first, or contact an Administrator or Super Admin for force deletion.",
  });
  return;
}
```

### **Logic Explanation**

**New Logic**: `canForceDelete = canDeleteAnyEvent || (canDeleteOwnEvent && isEventOrganizer)`

- **Super Admins**: Have `DELETE_ANY_EVENT` → Can delete any event with participants ✅
- **Administrators**: Have `DELETE_ANY_EVENT` → Can delete any event with participants ✅
- **Leaders (Event Creator)**: Have `DELETE_OWN_EVENT` + `isEventOrganizer` → Can delete own events with participants ✅
- **Leaders (Not Creator)**: Have `DELETE_OWN_EVENT` but not `isEventOrganizer` → Cannot delete ❌
- **Participants**: No delete permissions → Cannot delete ❌

## 🧪 **Testing & Verification**

### **Test Scenarios**

| Scenario | User Role     | Event Relationship | Has Participants | Expected Result | Test Status |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 1        | Super Admin   | Any Event          | Yes              | ✅ Can Delete   | ✅ Verified |
| 2        | Administrator | Any Event          | Yes              | ✅ Can Delete   | ✅ Fixed    |
| 3        | Leader        | Own Event          | Yes              | ✅ Can Delete   | ✅ Fixed    |
| 4        | Leader        | Other's Event      | Yes              | ❌ Blocked      | ✅ Correct  |
| 5        | Participant   | Any Event          | Yes              | ❌ Blocked      | ✅ Correct  |

### **Permission Matrix Verification**

```
Role                    DELETE_ANY_EVENT        DELETE_OWN_EVENT        Can Force Delete
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Super Admin             ✅                      ✅                      ✅
Administrator           ✅                      ✅                      ✅ (FIXED)
Leader                  ❌                      ✅                      ✅ (FIXED - own events only)
Participant             ❌                      ❌                      ❌
```

## 📊 **Impact Assessment**

### **Before Fix**

- **Super Admins**: Full functionality ✅
- **Administrators**: Limited functionality despite having `DELETE_ANY_EVENT` permission ❌
- **Leaders**: Cannot delete their own events with participants ❌
- **Participants**: Correctly blocked ✅

### **After Fix**

- **Super Admins**: Full functionality ✅
- **Administrators**: Full functionality restored ✅
- **Leaders**: Can delete own events with participants ✅
- **Participants**: Correctly blocked ✅

### **User Experience Improvement**

1. **Consistent Behavior**: All users with deletion permissions can now use them properly
2. **Reduced Admin Burden**: Administrators can handle deletions without escalating to Super Admin
3. **Leader Autonomy**: Event creators can manage their own events fully
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Updated error message reflects actual permission requirements

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**

### **Changes Made**

- ✅ Fixed hardcoded role check in `eventController.ts`
- ✅ Updated error message to reflect new permission structure
- ✅ Compiled TypeScript changes (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Created verification test script
- ✅ Updated project documentation

### **Backward Compatibility**

- ✅ No breaking changes to API
- ✅ Existing Super Admin functionality unchanged
- ✅ Only expands functionality for Administrators and Leaders

### **Security Review**

- ✅ Uses existing permission system (no new security vectors)
- ✅ Maintains proper role-based access control
- ✅ Event organizer verification still required for Leaders
- ✅ Participants still properly blocked from deletion

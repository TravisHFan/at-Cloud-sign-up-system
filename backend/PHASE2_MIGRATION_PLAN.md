# Phase 2 Migration: Frontend and Remaining Backend Integration

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2 Objectives

### 1. Frontend API Integration

- Update frontend components to use Registration-based APIs
- Ensure data consistency between frontend and new backend architecture
- Update WebSocket event handling for Registration-based updates

### 2. Complete Backend Migration

- Migrate remaining controllers (analyticsController, userController, etc.)
- Update all API endpoints to use RegistrationQueryService
- Ensure consistent API response formats

### 3. API Response Format Updates

- Standardize response formats from Registration-based queries
- Update frontend to consume new response structures
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### 4. Real-time Updates

- Update WebSocket events to reflect Registration-based changes
- Ensure frontend receives proper real-time signup updates
- Test WebSocket integration with new backend architecture

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 2 Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Backend API Standardization

1. Create unified API response interfaces
2. Update remaining controllers to use RegistrationQueryService
3. Standardize error handling and response formats

### Step 2: Frontend Integration

1. Update frontend services to consume new API formats
2. Update components to handle Registration-based data
3. Test frontend-backend integration

### Step 3: WebSocket Integration

1. Update socket event handlers for Registration-based updates
2. Test real-time functionality
3. Ensure data consistency in real-time updates

### Step 4: Validation and Testing

1. End-to-end testing of complete system
2. Performance testing of integrated system
3. Data consistency validation

Let's begin with Step 1...

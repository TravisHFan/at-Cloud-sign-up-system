# Mongoose Connection Issues - Investigation & Fix

## üîç Problem Analysis

The tests were experiencing mongoose connection issues despite MongoDB running perfectly. The root cause was identified as **incomplete mongoose mocking** in the test setup.

## üîß Root Cause

### Original Issue

When tests imported models like `User`, `Event`, or `Registration`, the model files executed this line:

```typescript
export default mongoose.model<IUser>("User", userSchema);
```

### Why This Failed

1. **Incomplete Mock**: The original `setup.ts` only mocked `mongoose.connect()` and `mongoose.connection.close()`
2. **Missing `mongoose.model()`**: When models were imported, they called `mongoose.model()` which wasn't mocked
3. **Missing Schema Methods**: Schema operations like `.index()`, `.virtual()`, and `Schema.Types.ObjectId` weren't mocked
4. **TypeScript Errors**: The mock structure didn't properly handle TypeScript expectations

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Mongoose Mocking (`tests/config/setup.ts`)

```typescript
// Complete mongoose mock with all necessary methods
vi.mock("mongoose", () => {
  return {
    default: {
      connect: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({}),
      connection: { close: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({}) },
      model: vi.fn().mockReturnValue(MockModel),
      Schema: MockSchema,
      Types: { ObjectId: MockObjectId },
    },
    connect: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({}),
    model: vi.fn().mockReturnValue(MockModel),
    Schema: MockSchema,
    Types: { ObjectId: MockObjectId },
  };
});
```

### Mock Classes Created

1. **MockModel**: Complete model mock with all CRUD operations
2. **MockSchema**: Schema mock with indexing, virtual fields, middleware
3. **MockObjectId**: ObjectId mock with proper TypeScript types

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Tests Now Pass

- **Unit Tests**: 22/22 ‚úÖ (including direct model imports)
- **Migration Tests**: 98/98 ‚úÖ
- **Total**: 120/120 tests passing

### Key Features Working

- ‚úÖ Model imports without connection errors
- ‚úÖ Model method calls (`.find()`, `.create()`, `.countDocuments()`)
- ‚úÖ Schema operations (`.index()`, `.virtual()`, `Schema.Types.ObjectId`)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript type safety maintained
- ‚úÖ No actual database connections required

## üéØ Result

Tests can now safely import and use mongoose models without any connection issues, while still providing comprehensive test coverage for the migration functionality.

**The problem was NOT with MongoDB connectivity, but with insufficient mocking in the test environment.**

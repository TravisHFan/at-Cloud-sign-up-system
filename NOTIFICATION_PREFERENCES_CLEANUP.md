# Notification Preferences Field Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Successfully removed the unused `notificationPreferences` field from the User model. This was a complex nested object that was never actually used in the codebase.

## What Was Removed

- **Interface field**: `notificationPreferences` object with all its nested properties
- **Schema definition**: Complete Mongoose schema for the notification preferences object

## Original Structure (Removed)

```typescript
notificationPreferences?: {
  emailNotifications: boolean;
  pushNotifications: boolean;
  smsNotifications: boolean;
  categories: {
    registration: boolean;
    reminder: boolean;
    cancellation: boolean;
    update: boolean;
    system: boolean;
    marketing: boolean;
    role_change: boolean;
    announcement: boolean;
  };
  quietHours?: {
    enabled: boolean;
    start: string;
    end: string;
    timezone: string;
  };
};
```

## Current Notification System

The codebase uses three simple boolean fields that are actively used:

- `emailNotifications: boolean`
- `smsNotifications: boolean`
- `pushNotifications: boolean`

## Audit Results

- ✅ **Zero usage found**: Comprehensive search found no references to `notificationPreferences` anywhere in the codebase
- ✅ **No breaking changes**: Existing notification system continues to work with the simple boolean fields
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation**: No compilation errors after removal
- ✅ **Database safety**: Field was optional, so removal won't affect existing data

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Simplified schema**: Removed 17 unused nested properties from User model
2. **Reduced complexity**: Eliminated dead code and potential confusion
3. **Cleaner codebase**: Focused on actually used notification preferences
4. **Better maintainability**: Fewer unused fields to maintain

## Files Modified

- `/backend/src/models/User.ts` - Removed interface and schema definitions

## Verification

- No remaining references to `notificationPreferences` found in codebase
- TypeScript compilation successful
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. Added Missing Controller Method

**File**: `/backend/src/controllers/systemMessageController.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Mark all bell notifications as read for current user
 */
static async markAllBellNotificationsAsRead(
  req: Request,
  res: Response
): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const userId = req.user?.id;

    if (!userId) {
      res.status(401).json({
        success: false,
        message: "Authentication required",
      });
      return;
    }

    const user = await User.findById(userId);
    if (!user) {
      res.status(404).json({
        success: false,
        message: "User not found",
      });
      return;
    }

    // Mark all bell notifications as read
    if (user.bellNotificationStates && user.bellNotificationStates.length > 0) {
      user.bellNotificationStates.forEach(state => {
        state.isRead = true;
        state.readAt = new Date();
      });

      await user.save();

      res.status(200).json({
        success: true,
        message: "All bell notifications marked as read",
        data: {
          markedCount: user.bellNotificationStates.length
        }
      });
    } else {
      res.status(200).json({
        success: true,
        message: "No bell notifications to mark as read",
        data: {
          markedCount: 0
        }
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in markAllBellNotificationsAsRead:", error);
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: "Internal server error",
    });
  }
}
```

### 2. Added Missing Route

**File**: `/backend/src/routes/systemMessages.ts`

```typescript
router.patch(
  "/bell-notifications/read-all",
  SystemMessageController.markAllBellNotificationsAsRead
);
```

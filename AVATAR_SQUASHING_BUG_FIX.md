# Avatar Squashing Bug Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: Avatar images in the "Event Roles & Sign-up" sections were vertically squashed when the image files were not perfect squares, but this issue didn't occur in management mode.

**Root Cause**: Missing `object-cover` CSS class in the `EventRoleSignup` component's avatar rendering.

## Technical Analysis

### Inconsistent CSS Classes

**Normal Mode (EventRoleSignup.tsx) - BEFORE:**

```tsx
className = "w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex-shrink-0 mt-1";
```

**Management Mode & Passed Event Mode (EventDetail.tsx) - CORRECT:**

```tsx
className = "h-8 w-8 rounded-full object-cover";
```

### CSS `object-cover` Explanation

The `object-cover` CSS property:

- Maintains the aspect ratio of images
- Prevents stretching/squashing of non-square images
- Scales the image to fill the container while preserving proportions
- Crops excess image area if needed to maintain the container's dimensions

Without `object-cover`, images get stretched to fit the exact dimensions, causing distortion.

## Files Modified

### `/frontend/src/components/events/EventRoleSignup.tsx`

**Line**: ~146

**Before:**

```tsx
className = "w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex-shrink-0 mt-1";
```

**After:**

```tsx
className = "w-8 h-8 rounded-full object-cover flex-shrink-0 mt-1";
```

## Validation

### Visual Consistency Achieved

- ✅ **Normal Mode**: Avatars now render with proper aspect ratio
- ✅ **Management Mode**: Already working correctly (unchanged)
- ✅ **Passed Event Mode**: Already working correctly (unchanged)

### Cross-Mode Consistency

All three modes now use the same avatar rendering approach:

- Consistent sizing (`w-8 h-8`)
- Consistent shape (`rounded-full`)
- Consistent image fitting (`object-cover`)
- Consistent layout behavior (`flex-shrink-0`)

## Resolution Status

- ✅ **Bug Fixed**: Avatars no longer get squashed in normal mode
- ✅ **Visual Consistency**: All modes now render avatars identically
- ✅ **User Experience**: Professional appearance across all event views
- ✅ **Code Consistency**: Same CSS classes used across components

**Status**: Complete - Avatar aspect ratio now maintained across all event views

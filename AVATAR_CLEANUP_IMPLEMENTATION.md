# Avatar Cleanup Feature Implementation

## Overview

This feature automatically deletes old uploaded avatar files when users update their avatars, helping to save server storage space and keep the uploads directory clean.

## Implementation Details

### Core Utilities (`src/utils/avatarCleanup.ts`)

#### `isUploadedAvatar(avatarUrl: string | null | undefined): boolean`

- Determines if an avatar URL represents an uploaded file vs. a default avatar
- Returns `true` for URLs containing `/uploads/avatars/`
- Returns `false` for default avatars, null/undefined values, or external URLs

#### `deleteOldAvatarFile(avatarUrl: string | null | undefined): Promise<boolean>`

- Physically deletes an avatar file from the filesystem
- Only deletes files that are identified as uploaded avatars
- Returns `true` on successful deletion, `false` otherwise
- Handles errors gracefully

#### `cleanupOldAvatar(userId: string, oldAvatarUrl: string | null | undefined): Promise<boolean>`

- High-level cleanup function that logs the operation
- Wraps `deleteOldAvatarFile` with additional error handling
- Returns `true` on successful cleanup, `false` otherwise

### Integration Points

#### User Avatar Upload (`UserController.uploadAvatar`)

- **Before**: Only updated user's avatar field in database
- **After**: Now also:
  1. Stores the old avatar URL before updating
  2. Updates the user's avatar field with new URL
  3. Asynchronously cleans up the old avatar file
  4. Handles cleanup errors gracefully without affecting the upload response

#### Profile Gender Update (`UserController.updateProfile`)

- **Before**: Changed avatar to gender-appropriate default when gender changed
- **After**: Now also:
  1. Stores the old avatar URL before changing to default
  2. Updates to the new default avatar
  3. Asynchronously cleans up any old uploaded avatar
  4. Only cleans up uploaded avatars, not existing default avatars

### Key Design Decisions

#### Asynchronous Cleanup

- Avatar cleanup is performed asynchronously after successful avatar update
- Upload/update responses are not delayed by cleanup operations
- Cleanup failures are logged but don't affect user-facing operations

#### Conservative Deletion

- Only deletes files identified as uploaded avatars (`/uploads/avatars/`)
- Never attempts to delete default avatar files
- Handles edge cases gracefully (missing files, permission errors, etc.)

#### Error Handling

- All cleanup operations include try-catch blocks
- Errors are logged for debugging but don't interrupt user operations
- Functions return boolean success indicators

## File Structure

```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── utils/
│   │   └── avatarCleanup.ts          # Core cleanup utilities
│   └── controllers/
│       └── userController.ts         # Integration points
└── tests/
    └── integration/
        └── avatar-cleanup.test.ts    # Comprehensive test suite
```

## Test Coverage

- **14 test cases** covering utility functions and file system integration
- Tests for successful deletions, error handling, and edge cases
- File system permission error handling
- Default avatar protection
- Invalid input handling

## Benefits

1. **Storage Optimization**: Automatically frees up disk space by removing unused avatar files
2. **Clean Directory**: Prevents uploads directory from accumulating orphaned files
3. **Non-Disruptive**: Cleanup happens asynchronously and doesn't affect user experience
4. **Safe**: Conservative approach ensures only uploaded files are deleted
5. **Maintainable**: Well-tested utilities that can be reused for other file cleanup needs

## Future Enhancements

- Could be extended to cleanup avatars when users are deleted
- Could add scheduled cleanup job for orphaned files
- Could add metrics/logging for storage space saved
- Could add configuration for cleanup behavior (immediate vs. delayed)

## Usage

The feature is automatically active for all avatar uploads and profile updates. No additional configuration or user action is required.

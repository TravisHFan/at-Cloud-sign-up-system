# Event Registration Bug Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: Event registrations were saving to the database successfully, but the frontend was not displaying the registered users in the roles. Users could see roles as "empty" even when they were full, but attempting to sign up again would correctly show "This role is at full capacity".

**Root Cause**: The `getEventById` API endpoint was returning raw event data without populated registration information, while the signup flow used `ResponseBuilderService.buildEventWithRegistrations()` to include registration data.

## Technical Analysis

### Database vs Frontend Disconnect

- ‚úÖ **Database**: Registrations were saving correctly
- ‚úÖ **Signup Logic**: Working correctly with capacity validation
- ‚ùå **Frontend Display**: Missing registration data due to API response issue

### Code Investigation

1. **EventController.signUpForEvent()**: Used `ResponseBuilderService.buildEventWithRegistrations()`
2. **EventController.getEventById()**: Only returned raw event data without registrations
3. **Frontend**: Correctly processed registration data when provided

## Solution Implemented

### Modified: `/backend/src/controllers/eventController.ts`

**Lines**: ~289-340 (getEventById method)

**Changes**:

- Replaced raw event response with `ResponseBuilderService.buildEventWithRegistrations()`
- Added debug logging to track registration data inclusion
- Maintained backward compatibility for frontend data structure

**Before**:

```typescript
res.status(200).json({
  success: true,
  data: { event }, // Raw event without registrations
});
```

**After**:

```typescript
const eventWithRegistrations =
  await ResponseBuilderService.buildEventWithRegistrations(id);
res.status(200).json({
  success: true,
  data: { event: eventWithRegistrations }, // Complete event with registration data
});
```

## Testing Results

### Backend Logs Confirmed

```
üîç [getEventById] Building event data with registrations for event 6889abdb33f5ce4cc613388e
‚úÖ [getEventById] Successfully built event data with 14 roles
   Role 1: Spiritual Covering - 1/1 registered  ‚Üê John Doe's registration now included
   Role 2: Tech Lead - 0/1 registered
   ...
```

### Expected Frontend Behavior

- ‚úÖ Roles now display registered users (e.g., John Doe in Spiritual Covering)
- ‚úÖ Role counts show accurate numbers (1/1 instead of 0/1)
- ‚úÖ Full roles display as occupied rather than empty
- ‚úÖ User avatars and names appear in role sections

## Data Structure Impact

The fix ensures the frontend receives complete `EventWithRegistrationData` including:

```typescript
{
  roles: [
    {
      id: "role_id",
      name: "Spiritual Covering",
      currentCount: 1,
      maxParticipants: 1,
      registrations: [
        {
          id: "registration_id",
          user: {
            id: "user_id",
            firstName: "John",
            lastName: "Doe",
            avatar: "avatar_url",
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ];
}
```

## Resolution Status

- ‚úÖ **Backend API Fixed**: `getEventById` now includes registration data
- ‚úÖ **Database Consistency**: No changes needed, data was always correct
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Compatibility**: Uses existing data processing logic
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket enhancements from previous debugging remain active

## Prevention Measures

- All event-related API endpoints should use `ResponseBuilderService` for consistent data structure
- Added logging to track registration data inclusion in responses
- Consider API endpoint documentation updates to specify registration data inclusion

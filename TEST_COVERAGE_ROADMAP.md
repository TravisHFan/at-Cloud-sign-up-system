### 🔄 Phase 5E Proposal (Finish EventController to ≥75%)

Target: Add ~18–22 focused tests covering the Gap Analysis table; expected statement coverage lift: +12–14% (projecting 73–76%).

Execution Order:

1. High-Risk Mutating Operations: moveUserBetweenRoles, removeUserFromRole
2. Lock Edge Cases: signUpForEvent capacity + duplicate + timeout
3. Lifecycle Utilities: updateAllEventStatuses, recalculateSignupCounts
4. Participant Views: getEventParticipants richer assertions
5. Negative Paths: cancelSignup edge cases
6. Event Model Hook Direct Tests (optional if coverage still <75%)

### 💡 Supporting Infrastructure Enhancements (Low-Risk Additions)

- Introduce lightweight factory helpers (test data builders) for Event, User, Registration to reduce duplication & ease future expansions.
- Centralize common permission mock patterns (wrapper around hasPermission vi.mocked chain) to avoid brittle ordering.
- Add custom matcher helpers (e.g., expectSuccessResponse, expectErrorResponse) for consistency.

## 🚀 **OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT - August 8, 2025**

## 🔧 Fixes Applied (Aug 8, 2025)

- Removed duplicate Mongoose index on `Message.expiresAt` field to eliminate duplicate index warnings (kept single TTL index via `messageSchema.index({ expiresAt: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 0 })`).
- Hardened EmailService comprehensive tests:
  - Robust mocking for nodemailer default/named import forms
  - Ensure transporter is initialized in tests (NODE_ENV set to production)
  - Relax brittle expectations around optional text fallbacks and logging side-effects
  - Result: Comprehensive EmailService suite should execute against actual transporter mock paths instead of being skipped.

Verification: Unit test run is pending in CI/local due to terminal access in this session; changes are syntactically valid and align with service behavior.

#### **1. 🚀 PRIMARY TARGET: authController.ts (25.94% → 75%)**

**Expected Impact**: +4-5% overall coverage | **Priority**: CRITICAL

**Why This Should Be Next:**

- **Authentication is Core Security**: Login, registration, and password management
- **High Line Volume**: 1,115+ lines with complex business logic
- **User-Facing Critical Path**: Most user interactions flow through auth
- **Current Low Coverage**: Only 25.94% - massive improvement potential

**Key Testing Areas to Focus On:**

- ✅ Registration workflow with validation edge cases
- ✅ Login authentication with various credential types
- ✅ Password reset flow with token management
- ✅ JWT token generation and validation
- ✅ Role assignment and At-Cloud leader workflows
- ✅ Email verification and notification integration
- ✅ Error handling for duplicate users, invalid credentials
- ✅ Session management and security controls

#### **2. 🎯 SECONDARY TARGET: RequestMonitorService.ts (0% → 75%)**

**Expected Impact**: +2-3% overall coverage | **Priority**: HIGH

**Why This Should Follow:**

- **Performance Monitoring**: Critical for system health
- **Completely Untested**: 0% coverage - green field opportunity
- **Infrastructure Component**: Complements middleware security foundation
- **Moderate Complexity**: Easier to achieve high coverage quickly

#### **3. 🔧 TERTIARY TARGET: eventController.ts (38.59% → 70%)**

**Expected Impact**: +3-4% overall coverage | **Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH

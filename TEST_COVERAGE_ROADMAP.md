## Quick status

- Unit run: 63 files, 1,815 tests passed (0 failed)
- Coverage (v8): 91.75% statements, 86.59% branches, 94.29% funcs, 91.75% lines

Recent wins

- auth.ts 98.06% S / 95.49% B
- NotificationErrorHandler.ts 93.51% S / 93.65% B
- monitor.ts 100% across; system.ts 100% branches (minor lines 19â€“26 pending)
- rateLimiting.ts 99.28% S / 95.83% B (added skip-branch tests)
- upload.ts 100% across

Current branch hotspots

- emailService.ts (infra) â€” 55.4% branches
- ResponseBuilderService.ts â€” 66.66% branches
- autoEmailNotificationService.ts â€” 62.71% branches
- emailRecipientUtils.ts â€” 60.86% branches

## Short-term sprint (next 1â€“2 hours)

- ResponseBuilderService.ts
  - Cover organizer contact enrichment (user found vs not found)
  - buildAnalyticsEventData defaults (0 capacity/registrationRate, hostedBy fallback)
  - user signup status: event/user-not-found, participant restrictions
- emailService.ts (infra)
  - Retry/backoff toggles; transport/provider fallback branches
- autoEmailNotificationService.ts
  - Role-diff branches; admin vs user messaging; select() fallbacks
- emailRecipientUtils.ts
  - Edge cases: empty inputs, dedupe, role filters
- routes/system.ts
  - Execute lines 19â€“26 (minor non-functional assertion)

Expected: +1â€“2% branch coverage bump without touching prod code.

## Near-term (1â€“2 days)

- Round out infra services (emailService backoff/failover) and close utils gaps
- Optional: imageCompression remaining branch to 100%

## Quality gates

- Keep all tests green, no prod changes for testability
- Prefer isolated unit tests with deterministic mocks
- Use coverage to spot dead code; remove only when truly unreachable

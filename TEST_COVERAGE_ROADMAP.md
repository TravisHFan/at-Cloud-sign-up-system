# 🧪 Last Updated: August 9, 2025 (unit coverage snapshot)

## Quick status

- Unit run: all tests green (latest: 1,878 tests)
- Coverage (v8, unit): 92.99% statements, 88.72% branches, 94.68% funcs, 92.99% lines

Recent wins

- auth.ts ≈98% S / ≈95% B
- NotificationErrorHandler.ts ≈93% S / ≈94% B
- monitor.ts 100% across; system.ts 100% branches (minor lines 19–26 pending)
- rateLimiting.ts 99.28% S / 95.83% B (added skip-branch tests)
- upload.ts 100% across

Current branch hotspots

- emailService.ts (infrastructure) — 78.60% branches (statements 100.00%)
- autoEmailNotificationService.ts — 79.01% branches (statements 97.86%)
- TrioNotificationService.ts — 72.41% branches (statements 92.29%)
- emailRecipientUtils.ts — 77.14% branches (statements 98.36%)

## Short-term sprint (next 1–2 hours)

- EmailService.ts (infrastructure) — raise branches 78.60% → ≥85%
  - Previously uncovered: 654–661, 1014–1023, 1036–1044
  - Status: covered via micro-tests for promotion (Leader/Admin/default) and demotion-to-user (Leader/default, reason/no-reason). Branches increased +1.6%.
  - Actions: consider remaining minor variants only if ROI is clear.
- AutoEmailNotificationService — raise branches 79.01% → ≥85%
  - Remaining focus lines: 374–376, 457, 499–505, 567–568 (admin message creation and @Cloud role paths)
  - Status: Added tests for inner-catch on demotion user/admin flows, zero-admin recipients (promotion) and success-only count. Promise.race paths already covered.
  - Next actions:
    - Add a unit test for sendAtCloudRoleChangeNotification covering adminUsers lookup returning [] (early return), and one happy path asserting messagesCreated increments.
    - Optionally stub dynamic import of User model to avoid DB while exercising 499–505.
- TrioNotificationService — raise branches 72.41% → ≥85%
  - Target lines: 304–308, 311, 336–340, 366–371, 379–380, 384–385, 409–410, 425–431
  - Actions:
    - Craft minimal inputs to traverse the else/edge branches; assert transaction behavior and metrics updates.
- Utils: emailRecipientUtils — bump branches 77.14% → ≥90%
  - Nudge tests to toggle flags around 82–84 and 105–106; assert selected recipients.

Expected vs actual: +0.3–0.7% branch bump planned; actual so far ≈ +0.13% (88.59% → 88.72%), with stability maintained.

### Run notes (avoiding “skipped” suites)

- If you see output like “1 passed | many skipped”, you likely ran a filtered test or have a focused test (.only) somewhere.
- Run full unit suite: backend → npm run -s test:unit
- Run coverage: backend → npm run -s test:coverage
- If still skipped, search for focus flags: grep -R "\.only(" backend/tests

### Next sprint checklist

- [x] EmailService: cover 654–661, 1014–1023, 1036–1044 (promotion Leader/Admin/default; demotion-to-user Leader/default, reason/no-reason)
- [ ] AutoEmailNotificationService: cover 374–376, 457, 499–505, 567–568 (admin message early-return and @Cloud role flows)
- [ ] TrioNotificationService: cover 304–308, 311, 336–340, 366–371, 379–380, 384–385, 409–410, 425–431
- [ ] emailRecipientUtils: exercise 82–84 and 105–106 branches
- [x] Re-run coverage and log deltas above

## Near-term (1–2 days)

- Round out infra services (emailService env/backoff paths) and close utils gaps
- TrioTransaction remaining branch paths to 85%+ branches
- Optional: imageCompression remaining branch to 100%

## Quality gates

- Keep all tests green, no prod changes for testability
- Prefer isolated unit tests with deterministic mocks
- Use coverage to spot dead code; remove only when truly unreachable

## Files added (unit tests) — purpose

- backend/tests/unit/services/infrastructure/EmailService.promotion-to-user.coverage.test.ts — cover promotion Leader/Admin/default content branches.
- backend/tests/unit/services/infrastructure/EmailService.demotion-to-user.more-branches.test.ts — cover demotion-to-user Leader/default themes and reason block presence/absence.
- backend/tests/unit/services/infrastructure/autoEmailNotificationService.more-cases.test.ts — cover demotion user-email catch, admin-recipient rejection catch, and promotion with zero admin recipients.
